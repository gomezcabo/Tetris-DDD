# Tetris DDD

## About The Project

"Tetris DDD" is a repository that implements the classic game of Tetris using Domain-Driven Design (DDD) principles. This approach separates the game's domain logic from the UI interface, allowing the same domain code (located in the `domain` folder) to be reused across four different projects utilizing:

1. React
2. Vue
3. Angular
4. NodeJS (as a terminal command)

The intent is to demonstrate the flexibility and reusability of DDD by applying it to different frameworks and runtime environments.

## Branch Implementations

Each implementation showcases the Tetris game, running on different technologies:

- **React**: A modern UI library for building interactive UIs declaratively.
- **Vue**: A progressive framework for building user interfaces.
- **Angular**: A platform for building mobile and desktop web applications.
- **NodeJS**: A JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine, used here to run Tetris as a terminal application.

## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps:

1. Clone the repo and install the dependencies:
    ```sh
    npm install
    ```
2. To launch a specific project, run the corresponding script:
    - For React:
        ```sh
        npm run react
        ```
    - For Vue:
        ```sh
        npm run vue
        ```
    - For Angular:
        ```sh
        npm run angular
        ```
    - For the terminal-based version:
        ```sh
        npm run terminal
        ```

## Running Tests

To run the tests configured in the domain folder, execute:

```sh
npm run test
```

## Prerequisites

Before running the application, make sure you have `npm` installed on your system, which comes with Node.js. You can download and install Node.js from [here](https://nodejs.org/).
